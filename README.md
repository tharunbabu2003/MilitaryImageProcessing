# Military Image Classification using VGG16 and SVM

This repository contains code for a project that classifies military images based on their quality. The project uses the VGG16 model for feature extraction and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification.

## Project Overview

1. **Feature Extraction**: The VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is used to extract features from the images.

2. **Classification**: The extracted features are then used to classify the images into four categories: Blurry, Noisy, Contrast, and Sharp. This classification is done using the SVM algorithm.
